# image-retrieval

You can download images changing your position on google map.

You can change your current position by dragging red marker on the map. Images surrounding marker will be automatically popped out.

In each time, you can store 100 images, but can be adjustable by putting configuration button.

Json data is installed on MongoDB so that same data should not be installed twice.

You can download row image data after you download low data. 

Tag search (ex restaurant, park..) with location can be possible with panoramio's own website but not provided by API.
For details, take a look at panoramio API which is attached as a link from root page.

Do not forget launching MongoDB server.
